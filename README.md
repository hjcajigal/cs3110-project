# CS3110 Project
## Description
My project will be a website that allows you to play chess and certain chess variants (e.g. freestyle chess). The website will allow you to choose what kind of chess you want to play and adjust any rules (e.g. turn timers). It will be very similar to Chess.com, but will be local multiplayer only. 

## Feature Roadmap (Overall Plan)
1. Basic chess functionality (movement/capturing)
2. Front page.
3. Turn Timers
4. Advanced chess functionality (en passant, castling, promotion)
5. Endgame detection (checkmates and draws)
6. Standard variants
7. Fairy piece variants
8. Other variants

## Sprint Plan
This first sprint I plan on setting up the basic chess page layout and  getting the basic chess functionality completed.
